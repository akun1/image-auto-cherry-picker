# img-picker-tool

Background:

I am a freelance photographer on my freetime and many times after a shoot, I have ~1000 pictures to send to my client. When I send them all to my client, a lot of times the client will simply message/email me the numbers of each file name. So if the file is DSC03989.PNG, they'll send me 3989. This isn't too tedious when they need 3-10 pictures. However, recently its been upwards of 50 and some requests ~200. For this reason, I decided to make a script that would cherry pick the files for me and copy them over to an alternate directory.

This tool takes a list of all the image numbers and the proper paths and moves the pictures into another directory.
