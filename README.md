# img-picker-tool

Background:

I am a freelance photographer on my freetime and many times after a shoot, I have ~1000 pictures to send to my client. When I send them all to my client, many times they send back the numbers of the images they want.

This tool takes a list of all the image numbers and the proper paths and moves the pictures into another directory.
